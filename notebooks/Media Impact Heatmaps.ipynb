For a given network structure, This may be averaged over many samples to give an estimate of the overall effect of a certain amount of media influence. Somewhat surprisingly, they found that for most networks, including the natural network structures obtained from mid-2000s college Facebook networks, the media impact is not always increased by increasing the number of media accounts or their follower counts. Instead, the highest media impact is usually found along a curve in the (accounts, followers/account) plane.\n",

For a more nuanced measurement, we can compute $F(x; x_M)$, the cumulative distribution function for the distance of non-media accounts from the media ideology $x_M$. The relative media entrainment of two media ideologies $x_M, x_N$ is measured by\n",
