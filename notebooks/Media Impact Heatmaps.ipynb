For a given network structure, This may be averaged over many samples to give an estimate of the overall effect of a certain amount of media influence. Somewhat surprisingly, they found that for most networks, including the natural network structures obtained from mid-2000s college Facebook networks, the media impact is not always increased by increasing the number of media accounts or their follower counts. Instead, the highest media impact is usually found along a curve in the (accounts, followers/account) plane.\n",

    "In the real world, of course, not all media influence comes from the same ideological position. Indeed, a major goal of this research is to better understand the effect of divergent media ideology on the formation of so-called \"echo chambers.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Average Distance Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the statistic $R$ defined before, we define the *average distance impact* statistic by averaging the ideological distance between each individual's account at convergence with and without media presence.\n",

    "A very simple way to measure a media position's \"success\" in capturing the aggregate population is to compute the mean ideological position of all non-media accounts.\n",

    "#### Follower Entrainment\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we define several metrics for absolute and relative follower entrainment. A simple metric is $\\hat p_E$, the proportion of non-media accounts that are near the media account's ideology; as a first approximation, we consider \"near\" to mean within $2\\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the simulation convergence tolerance. For a more nuanced measurement, we can compute $F(x; x_M)$, the cumulative distribution function for the distance of non-media accounts from the media ideology $x_M$. The relative media entrainment of two media ideologies $x_M, x_N$ is measured by\n",
